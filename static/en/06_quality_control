Tochka Free Market has partnered with DNMAvengers, an forum and community whom are dedicated to reduce harm & spread awareness via testing product suspected of containing adulterations.

This partnership will create an system that makes it very hard for vendors at Tochka Free Market to sell adulterated products without it going unnoticed.

If you suspect you have recieved an adulterated/wrong substance you can create an report on DNMAvengers forum.

DNMAvengers forum staff will check the report, look for any complaints in the vendors reviews, additional members will add anything any info they may have, and then an decision whether or not to test the substance is made.
