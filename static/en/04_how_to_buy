Gentlemen, please read this guide on how to operate on Tochka. This guide will help you purchase things on Tochka. It’s very important that you have read and understood every step. 

## Preparation

### Use VPN Service

Every time you use your computer your IP address is shown which reveals your actual physical address which means you can be traced very easily. A VPN must be used along with Tor (Tor is the free browser explained below) to make your online activity anonymous. When using a VPN Service it will hide your identity and location while also encrypting all of you internet traffic from everyone including your internet service provider. This technology will also protect you from identity theft and hacking when using free wifi because everything is encrypted. Any time you are searching for music, movies to download, pirated content, drugs or anything illegal then you should be using a VPN to fly under the radar. The law is trying to monitor everything we do now so don’t make it easy for them, don’t end up like the original mastermind of Silk Road and get busted. This is a must have in your anonymous arsenal.

Your first-ever step in buying something via any marketplace whatsoever, is properly setting-up your digital environment. Following below is a bare standard minimum in order to stay safe when buying personal items. After you are done, make sure you glance at the Security Tutorials section for several additional tips in security.

### Tor Browser

To visit the darkweb, you will need to visit https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html and download what is known as the Tor Browser Bundle, for your current OS. There are plenty of detailed instructions for installing it on its download webpage, for OS X, Windows, even Debian, too.

### PGP

PGP is an especially useful method of encrypting/decrypting sensitive messages. It’s not very good of an idea to tell a vendor, your home address without first encrypting it, because should the hidden service get seized, LE will have clearly-cut evidence of the crime you have committed. 

### Bitcoin

You’ll need to buy Bitcoin, something you can do with paypal or credit cards, find a local Bitcoin ATM machine, or order with fiat cash. Whichever way you buy Bitcoin is completely up to your own preference. Regardless, LocalBitcoin is one of the most widely-popular options for a reason: it can be done anonymously. Don’t stay connected Tor while purchasing Bitcoin, because it is totally legal and buying through Tor often becomes a cumbersome ordeal.

### Wallet

Now that you’ve purchased some Bitcoins, you need to store them somewhere. A particularly great choice is the open-source Electrum Wallet. This is also cross-platform and has a downloadable version for Android phones. Go ahead, download it here. Using the Electrum Wallet is quite easily accomplished.

### Tips

Some beginning tips for new users are laid out, here – some are from personal experiences and others from stories across the web:

* Remember to use your biological name because nothing draws more attention than a fake name; however, use a drop system: this is where you employ a chain of houses through where the item travels after having been shipped or a P.O. Box which you can get for almost no money and even a faux name (be sure to have the forged documents to back your case up).
* If you do end up deciding to use a faux name, ensure you’ve got real-looking document forgeries to back that up, should confrontation occur. Fake identification, plus utility-bill scans are mostly sufficient to open up a P.O. box under said faux name.
* Be patient when you can, during the majority of the time. Tochka Free Market isn’t Amazon – things do often have totally unexpected delays; vendors usually mark ordered items as shipped immediately upon receiving the notification, even though they only ship the day after then. Weather and holidays can significantly delay otherwise-proper shipping/delivery time. The only time you should rebut an order’s shipment after not arriving, is once you have waited, in the least, 14 days after the failed expected delivery, or around when Auto-finalize is almost activated.
* Encrypt all you can, including messages you send. It’s worth this small extra effort to avoid penitentiary time.
* Should there be any negative experience with a vendor, try to message them, prior to giving a bad review. Chances are that the vendor will go to extreme lengths to make sure you get what you need, and have it all sorted sufficiently. Be as kind and polite as you can; it will move you farther in the process of getting stuff done.
* No one should ever know you make purchases on DNMs. This includes not telling your friends or even close family.
Anything in the market that looks too great to be true, is, in all probability, a scam.

## How to place orders
